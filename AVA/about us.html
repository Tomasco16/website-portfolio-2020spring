  <p> AVA is born on experience and family. The beach is not a party if you’re not surrounded by the ones you love. It’s our goal here at AVA to not only get you there, but also all your stuff. That way you can worry more about relaxing than lugging belongings. From chairs to coolers, umbrellas to toys the AVA way is to carry all your beach essentials to spend the day the way The Beach Boys intended. ‘Getting there fast then taking it slow down in Kokomo.’
It as started as a wheelbarrow that got us to and from the beach. One trip was all it took for a day of dreams on the beach in our beloved Avalon New Jersey. Our goal is to give that back to others while giving back to the community. Forged in quality and sworn by customer service it is our pleasure to see you to enjoy the beach day in and day out.
