      <p> At AVA our reach extends beyond your journey to the beach. With monthly beach cleanups we strive to protect the fragile ecosystem we enter. Itâ€™s the least we can do. Join us monthly to pick up plastic and other debris that is hurting the oceans wildlife. We will provide the location, time and carts to fill with trash. We then take them to a safe disposal site free of charge to you. Join and you will also get free AVA merch. Sing up below for a fun day with AVA.  </p>
